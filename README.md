The website was created with React and Bootstrap. The SOURCE CODE only contains files changed / added to the basic version of React app.

To use the SOURCE CODE in your project, create a default application in React, add React-Bootstrap library, then add the files from SOURCE CODE (replace each duplicate with SOURCE CODE file).
